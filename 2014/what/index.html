Oh, Hai!

We are happy that you are looking the source code. Unfortunetly thats nothing magic here ):

The markdown file is located on /presentation.md

We have built that with a lot of things: hallo, ace9, marked, remarked, remark, parse, angular and some CSS3 and HTML5 love.

If you have some ideas, ping us on hey@pitch.rocks
